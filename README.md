Homework 4 repository for SOFT2101 Principles of Software Engineering



This repository demonstrates core Git workflows for branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

It includes a Java console program that prints numbers between two inputs, then evolves through

feature branches to print only odd or even numbers.



The goal is to practice clean commits, .gitignore rules, and safe merges.
