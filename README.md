Homework 4 repository for SOFT2101 Principles of Software Engineering


This repository demonstrates core Git workflows for branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

It includes a Java console program that prints numbers between two inputs, then evolves through feature branches to print only odd or even numbers.

The goal is to practice clean commits, .gitignore rules, and safe merges.
